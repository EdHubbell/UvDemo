// To render as HTML in Visual Studio Code, hit F1 and type Asciidoc - Should then allow you to choose the command AsciiDoc: Save to HTML Document

Help text files are here and rendered as HTML via the AsciiDoc plugin in Visual Studio Code, so they are easy to edit. The help files are included in the https:// [project git repository], so it is easy for the programming team to keep them current.
